# VISController

The **Video Input Switcher controller** (VISController) is a little yet powerful app for **Android OS**, compatible with phones and tablets.

The aim of the app is to let users control the **ClassX VideoInputSwitcher®** plugin with an easy gui that's about 1:1 the real user interface we can find on LiveBoard®

The app itself has been created with **AppInventor®** and uses the LBControl TCP/IP protocol of ClassX LiveBoard
