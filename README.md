The *Video Input Switcher controller* (VISController) is a little yet powerful app for _Android OS_, compatible with phones and tablets.

The aim of the app is to let users control the ClassX VideoInputSwitcher® plugin with an easy gui that's about 1:1 the real user interface we can find on LiveBoard®

The app itself has been created with AppInventor® and uses the LBControl TCP/IP protocol of ClassX LiveBoard
